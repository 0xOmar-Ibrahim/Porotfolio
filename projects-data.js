      LABstar is a mobile control panel for an elevator system, built in Flutter and paired with an ESP32-based hardware controller. The app connects to a dedicated local access point ("LABstar Elevator") and communicates floor selection and door commands over the TCP protocol directly to the ESP32, which drives the elevator's relay/motor hardware. The UI presents a clean numbered floor keypad (0–11) alongside dedicated Open and Close door controls, styled for quick, glanceable operation. A built-in connectivity guard detects when the phone isn't joined to the elevator's Wi-Fi network and walks the user through connecting via Settings, preventing commands from being sent without an active link. Access is role-based, distinguishing between admin and technician accounts to control which functions (e.g., configuration vs. basic operation) each user type can perform.

    summary: "Custom PCB built around an ESP32 (NodeMCU-32S) that independently drives 21 relay channels through darlington transistor arrays, with an onboard buck converter for clean 5V logic power.",
    fullDescription: `
      A complete relay-control mainboard designed in EasyEDA, centered on an ESP32-WROOM-32 (NodeMCU-32S) module. All 21 GPIO-driven outputs are buffered through three 16-pin darlington driver arrays (Q1, Q2, Q3) instead of driving relay coils directly from the MCU, protecting the ESP32 from back-EMF and current overload. Each relay stage has its own transistor switch, base resistor, and snubber capacitor, laid out in repeatable "Control Relays" blocks (three groups of 7) for easy routing and debugging. Onboard power regulation steps 12V down to a stable 5V rail using an LM2587 switching regulator, with input/output filtering caps and a flyback diode for the inductor. A dedicated terminal block breaks out the 4 input control lines, 12V, 5V, 3.3V, and GND for external wiring.
